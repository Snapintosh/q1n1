# Installing and running q1n1 on the ASUS Zenbook A16

q1n1 is a fork of [m1n1](https://github.com/AsahiLinux/m1n1) retargeted at a
Snapdragon laptop. Where m1n1 boots on Apple Silicon from iBoot, q1n1 is a UEFI
application: firmware loads it, it takes the machine at EL2 after
`ExitBootServices`, and then serves the m1n1 proxy protocol so a host machine can
drive it interactively.

Everything below is what was actually done on one machine. Read
[the porting record](A16-Q1N1-PROXY.md) for why each piece is the way it is.

## What this was built and tested on

| | |
| --- | --- |
| Target | ASUS Zenbook A16, UX3607OA, Snapdragon X2E-96-100, BIOS 312 |
| Target OS | Windows on ARM (stays installed; q1n1 boots beside it) |
| Host | macOS on Apple Silicon |
| Link | USB-C, either a Dell WD22TB4 dock or a bare C-to-C cable |

**Nothing here is portable to another machine as-is.** The UEFI boot entry GUID,
the shell's `fs2:` mapping for the ESP, the DWC3 base addresses and the firmware
version check are all specific to this laptop. The sections below mark the
values you would have to re-derive.

## Host prerequisites

```sh
brew install llvm lld qemu          # clang targeting aarch64, lld, qemu-system-aarch64
```

The build looks for `/opt/homebrew/opt/llvm/bin/clang` and falls back to
whatever `clang` is on `PATH`; override with `make LLVM=/path/to/llvm/bin`. The
Python tools need only the standard library — no `pip install`, and
deliberately no `pyserial`.

## Build

```sh
make uefi                 # build/uefi/q1n1.efi plus the chainloadable stages
```

Artifacts:

| file | what it is |
| --- | --- |
| `build/uefi/q1n1.efi` | the UEFI application; this is what goes on the ESP |
| `build/uefi/q1n1-stage.bin` | flat stage linked for `0xb0000000` |
| `build/uefi/q1n1-stage-alt.bin` | same, linked for `0xb0800000` |
| `build/uefi/q1n1-stage-qemu*.bin` | the same two for QEMU's memory map |

Two stage slots exist so a chainload never overwrites the image it is running
from; the tooling picks whichever slot is free.

## Test before touching hardware

```sh
python3 tools/test-uefi.py --proxy       # boots the real EFI binary in QEMU at EL2
python3 tools/test-q1n1-proxy.py         # proxy protocol, native, ASan + UBSan
python3 tools/test-q1n1-xhci.py          # xHCI and NCM against a simulated controller
python3 tools/test-q1n1-ncmproxy.py      # IPv6/UDP framing, packet by packet
```

The QEMU test boots the actual `q1n1.efi`, reaches EL2 after `ExitBootServices`,
and exercises the proxy including two chainload generations. The three native
suites run the real driver sources against simulators under sanitizers. All four
pass on a clean tree; if they do not, do not put anything on the laptop.

`--firmware` defaults to `/opt/homebrew/share/qemu/edk2-aarch64-code.fd`.

## Install on the A16

The payload lives on the existing EFI System Partition next to the Windows boot
manager. Windows stays first in the firmware boot order — q1n1 is only reached
when something arms `BootNext`, and the startup script always falls back to
Windows. That fallback is the safety net: a failed payload costs a power cycle,
not an install.

Copy `build/uefi/q1n1.efi` (as `q1n1-usb.efi`) and
`tools/install-a16-q1n1-boot.ps1` to the A16, then from an **elevated**
PowerShell in that directory:

```powershell
$hash = (Get-FileHash .\q1n1-usb.efi -Algorithm SHA256).Hash.ToLower()
.\install-a16-q1n1-boot.ps1 -PayloadSHA256 $hash -BootEntry '{<boot-entry-guid>}'
```

The script refuses to run unless the hash you pass matches the file, which is
what stops a half-copied payload from being installed. It writes:

- `\EFI\q1n1\q1n1-usb.efi` — the payload
- `\startup.nsh` — runs the payload with `--boot --auto`, and chains to
  `\EFI\Microsoft\Boot\bootmgfw.efi` if the payload is missing or returns 0

**Machine-specific values**: the UEFI Shell boot entry GUID (passed as
`-BootEntry`) and the `fs2:` shell mapping (inside the script) for the NVMe ESP. On another
machine, find the shell entry with `bcdedit /enum {fwbootmgr}` and the ESP
mapping with `map` at the shell prompt.

## Boot into q1n1

`BootNext` is one-shot, and firmware here does not support runtime
`SetVariable`, so it has to be armed from Windows or from q1n1's own boot
window:

```sh
export A16_SSH_TARGET=user@a16-address     # only needed for the Windows-side reboot
python3 tools/a16ctl.py boot q1n1          # arms BootNext and reboots; ~25 s
python3 tools/a16ctl.py boot windows       # go back
python3 tools/a16ctl.py status             # where is it now
```

`a16ctl.py` needs SSH to the A16 only to arm the reboot from Windows. It finds
the boot script in `C:\q1n1-bringup` or a unique `q1n1-bringup*` directory in
the Windows user's profile; set `A16_REMOTE_DIR` if there is more than one.
Once q1n1 is running, SSH is not involved.

On boot the payload shows a boot window for 25 s on the USB CDC console
(`A16-Q1N1-BOOT`). `a16ctl.py claim q1n1` answers it without a reboot. With
`--auto` it picks the proxy on timeout whether USB0 is already configured or
not. Without a USB0 host it uses the direct USB discovery path. An explicit
`windows` choice or a refused boot still returns to Windows.

## Connect

Both A16 USB-C controllers independently discover the USB data direction.
Either can present a CDC serial device to a Mac host or enumerate the Mac as
an NCM device and serve the proxy over IPv6 UDP. Both links can work at once.
The reader discovers the two CDC identities and active Mac USB NCM interfaces,
then handshakes candidates; no fixed Mac interface name is needed.

```sh
python3 tools/q1n1proxy.py shell            # interactive
python3 tools/q1n1proxy.py acpi             # one-shot commands
python3 tools/q1n1proxy.py info             # selected endpoint and both port states
```

CDC identities are `A16-Q1N1-EL2` on USB0 and `A16-Q1N1-EL2B` on USB1.
To select a particular NCM connection explicitly, use the interface observed
on this Mac; its number can change when the cable moves:

```sh
python3 tools/q1n1proxy.py --device udp://en5 info
```

q1n1 answers on a fixed address, `fe80::4919`, port 4919. Do not derive the
address from the local interface's MAC — that is not the MAC the NCM descriptor
carries, and the two are not required to match.

Firmware does not expose the USB0 boot window over the bare cable. With the
installed `--boot --auto` script, wait for that window's 25-second timeout and
then for either EL2 USB link to appear. Physical tests verified all six
direct-cable pairings across three Mac ports and both A16 ports, with
disconnect recovery. The dock passed both A16 ports through the second Mac
port; other dock pairings remain unverified. See the current
[port qualification record](A16-USB-PORT-INDEPENDENCE.md), including the
installed-image and cold-boot qualification status.

## The edit-test loop

A chainload replaces the running EL2 code without rebooting:

```sh
python3 tools/q1n1proxy.py chainload build/uefi/q1n1-stage.bin
```

629 KB uploads, verifies and jumps in about 0.2 s over either transport. The new
stage inherits bootinfo, bumps `stage_generation` so you can prove the new code
is the one answering, and adopts a running NCM link in place rather than
resetting the controller — resetting is what makes the far end stop enumerating
until the cable is physically replugged.

Stages publish their USB state layout. The reader refuses an incompatible
handoff while NCM is active; use a cold boot of the new EFI for such a change.

`--xhci` asks the stage to bring up USB1 and open the NCM link itself.

## When it goes wrong

| symptom | what it means |
| --- | --- |
| Boot window prints `USB0 boot window unavailable` | USB0's firmware state (policy, gate, role, an existing Function driver: what Windows and the Type-C controller left) refused the boot window, or the USB Function driver did not start. With `--auto` the payload takes the direct USB link after 5 s (W: Windows, S: shell). Before 2026-09-25 this returned to Windows; that is what stopped every boot from Windows after that day's GPT change session. |
| Screen shows `q1n1: unhandled exception … halted` | faulted with no console to report to. Power-cycle; that spends the one-shot `BootNext` and returns to Windows. |
| Boot loops | the boot window re-armed `BootNext` before faulting. Plug the dock in, catch the boot window, send `windows`. |
| `PORTSC` reads `0x603` (Full) instead of `0xe03` (High) | the far end wedged after a controller reset. Physically replug the cable. |
| After `a16ctl.py boot q1n1` only the `A16-Q1N1-EL2B` serial port returns, no NCM interface | after a reset the Mac is the USB host on the cable. Replug, or chainload a `Q1N1_GADGET_NCM` stage over that serial port ([A16-USB-REARM.md](A16-USB-REARM.md)). |
| Neighbour entry stays `(incomplete)` | nothing is answering at that address — check you are using `fe80::4919`. |
| Target values read as plausible nonsense | stale objects. `rm -rf build/uefi && make uefi` before debugging further. |

Recovery never needs more than the power button: the firmware boot order still
has Windows first, and `BootNext` only ever survives one boot.
