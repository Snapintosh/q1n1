# q1n1: m1n1 on a Snapdragon laptop

A fork of [m1n1](https://github.com/AsahiLinux/m1n1) retargeted from Apple
Silicon to the ASUS Zenbook A16 (UX3607OA / Snapdragon X2E-96-100). Where m1n1
is loaded by iBoot, q1n1 is a UEFI application: firmware loads it, it takes the
machine at EL2 after `ExitBootServices`, and then serves m1n1's proxy protocol
so a host can drive the hardware interactively.

of the running machine over the proxy while it sat at EL2.*

## About this fork

q1n1 is an EL2 proxy and UEFI application for the ASUS Zenbook A16
(UX3607OA) with the Snapdragon X2 Elite (X2E-96-100). It is the boot and
bring-up stage used by [Snapintosh](https://github.com/Acelogic/Snapintosh).

- **Status:** experimental bring-up software for one laptop model. It runs at
  EL2 on real hardware and can write to the machine's SSD when asked to; use it
  only on a machine whose data you can lose.
- **Upstream base:** m1n1 commit
  [`b4654b3`](https://github.com/AsahiLinux/m1n1/commit/b4654b32941d51afdb77579d63e7cb1aa6c03ecc)
  (2026-09-06). The q1n1 changes are one commit on top of it; m1n1's history,
  and with it its authorship, is kept below that commit.
- **Independent fork:** q1n1 is not affiliated with or endorsed by Asahi Linux.
  Please don't report q1n1 issues to Asahi Linux or m1n1 upstream.

## What works

- **EL2 after ExitBootServices** on real hardware, with a framebuffer console.
  Entered directly, without slbounce. See the
  [first hardware boot record](docs/A16-FIRST-EL2-BOOT.md).
- **The m1n1 proxy protocol at EL2** over USB, with guarded MMIO access, memory
  transfer and code upload, so the usual m1n1 host-side idioms work.
- **Boot control**: `tools/a16ctl.py` boots the laptop into q1n1 from Windows,
  from its boot window, or from q1n1 itself — a q1n1-to-q1n1 restart never
  passes through Windows. Windows stays first in the firmware boot order and a
  failed payload falls back to it.
- **Chainloading**: replace the running EL2 code in ~0.3 s without rebooting,
  which is what makes this iterable at all.
- **Its own USB stack on both A16 ports.** Each controller discovers a working
  host/NCM or device/CDC connection, recovers after cable moves, and serves the
  proxy independently. The Mac reader discovers either transport without a
  fixed serial path or network-interface number. Direct connections passed all
  six Mac/A16 port pairings; dock connections passed both A16 ports on the
  tested working Mac port. See the
  [port qualification record](docs/A16-USB-PORT-INDEPENDENCE.md) for evidence
  and the remaining dock qualification limits.
- **UCSI 2.1** register access and connector queries.

Not yet: the guest hypervisor, SMP, or any Apple-specific drivers.

Each piece has a written record of how it was established, including the things

## Build and test

```shell
make uefi        # build/uefi/q1n1.efi and the chainloadable stages
```

QEMU boots the real binary to EL2 and checks it end to end, including two
chainloads; the native suites run the drivers against register models under
ASan/UBSan, with no firmware and no physical MMIO:

```shell
python3 tools/test-uefi.py --proxy
python3 tools/test-q1n1-proxy.py
python3 tools/test-q1n1-xhci.py
python3 tools/test-q1n1-ncmproxy.py
python3 tools/test-q1n1-ports.py
python3 tools/test-a16-link-rearm.py
python3 tools/test-q1n1-udp-loss.py
python3 tools/test-q1n1-stage-contract.py
```

QEMU does not model this machine's Type-C hardware, so the direct-USB path is
covered by the native tests plus the hardware logs cited in
[A16-USB-PORT-INDEPENDENCE.md](docs/A16-USB-PORT-INDEPENDENCE.md).

## Boot emblem

The mark on the boot screen is q1n1's own dragon, an original project emblem
packaged from `data/q1n1/` — see that directory's README for how it was made and
how to repackage it. It carries an alpha channel and is composited onto the
screen, so it does not stamp a black square over whatever firmware left there.
A chainloaded stage takes its placement from the host:

```shell
python3 tools/q1n1proxy.py chainload build/uefi/q1n1-stage.bin --logo corner
```

`centre` is the default and matches m1n1's placement; `corner` parks the emblem
in a different corner per chainload generation, so the screen says at a glance
which one is running; `none` draws nothing; `asahi` draws the upstream Asahi
logomark instead.
